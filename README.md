# SNKEZ-Mob-Spawning

Creating a mob spawning mechanic in unity utilizing object pooling methods. Inspiration from the game SNKEZ.

## Enemy object

- Deciding to create 4 different types of enemy, using shapes and colours to represent different enemy/mob.
- Each enemy will have different AI movements and its determined by the shape/colour of the enemy.
- The shape/colour will be determined at the beginning when the enemy object is initialized and from that it can detect what movement pattern the object will have.
